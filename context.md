# Task: Integrate Gemini Provider (Connectivity Test)

## Goal
Integrate Gemini into the UI, allowing a user to save an API key and perform a basic connectivity test.

## TODO
- [ ] **Plan:** Create context.md and establish a todo list.
- [ ] **HTML:** Add a "Provider Settings" panel to `index.html`.
- [ ] **CSS:** Style the new settings panel in `style.css`.
- [ ] **JavaScript:** Implement logic in `script.js` to save the API key to localStorage and test the connection.
- [ ] **Verify:** Confirm the UI and connectivity test work correctly.

## Notes
- The connection test should simply confirm that the API key is valid by getting a fixed "READY" response.
- No complex tool-calling or data cleaning is required at this stage.
- The API key should be stored in `localStorage`.
