# Goal
- Provide a simple, unified vanilla frontend for the CSV Agent with a persistent resizer and multi-step agent orchestration.
- Surface agent thinking/logs and document the iteration flow for easy maintenance.

# TODO
1. Match left/right layout + resizer styling to reference mock. ✅
2. Introduce drag/drop zone + assistant controls/new session flow. ✅
3. Mirror latest UI/UX notes in README once dust settles. ✅

# Notes
- Header now matches reference (title + New Session/History/Settings/Upload buttons).
- Left pane hosts dashed dropzone with drag-state feedback; right pane assistant has icon controls + always-visible divider.
- Multi-step planner + logging remain; README still reflects earlier version and needs another pass when UI stabilizes.
- Need bilingual response flow per instructions.

# Progress
- Rebuilt layout with dropzone/resizer + assistant icons; wired new session/history buttons and drop handling, refreshed README to document flow.
