# CSV Agent Task Context

## Goal
Implement a tool execution flow for a `get_current_date` tool in a vanilla JavaScript project. The agent should be able to understand a user's request for the time, execute a tool, and display the result in the UI.

## TODO
- [ ] Setup basic HTML, CSS, and JS files.
- [ ] Implement the core logic to simulate LLM responses and manage the chat flow.
- [ ] Implement the `get_current_date` tool.
- [ ] Implement the tool executor to call the tool based on the `tool_plan`.
- [ ] Implement result handling to update the UI.
- [ ] Handle tool name aliases and implicit mapping.
- [ ] Implement error handling.
- [ ] Update documentation (`README.md`).

## Notes
- The project is a pure vanilla frontend application (HTML, CSS, JS).
- No backend or Node.js is required.
- The focus is on the tool execution mechanism, not on a real LLM integration. We will simulate the LLM's JSON output.

## Progress
- Initial setup and planning complete. Starting with file creation.
